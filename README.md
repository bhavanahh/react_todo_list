# React Todo List

This is a small React todo list app that I built to understand how React works.

I made this project mainly to study the flow of React, like how components work, how state changes, and how everything updates on the screen when we interact with it.

## Why I made this

To understand the basic flow of React

To learn how components and state work

To practice handling user actions

To get comfortable with React concepts

## Tech Used

React

JavaScript

HTML

CSS

Vite


Note:This project is just for learning and practice, not a production-level app.This was pureply made for me to practise and be familiar with concepts of react
